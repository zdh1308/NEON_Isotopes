DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10086.001

Name: Soil physical and chemical properties, periodic

Description: Soil physical and chemical properties from the top 30 cm of the profile from periodic soil core collections. Data are reported by horizon (mineral vs. organic). See initial characterization and megapit products for additional soil data.

NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Observation System

Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's periodic soil sampling, as well as measurements of pH, moisture, chemistry, and stable isotopes. Samples collected as part of this product are also used for microbial measurements; those data can be found in associated data products.

Soil is defined as the upper layer of the earth's surface where plants grow and consists of decomposing organic material and inorganic particles such as clay and rock. Soils are sampled by horizon type (organic or mineral) to a maximum depth of 30cm. Following field collection, all soils are measured for moisture and pH, and a subset are also measured for microbial abundance and composition, inorganic nitrogen (N) pools and net transformation rates, and total soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and stable isotopes by external laboratories. Frozen soil for the microbial archive is also collected for many samples, and during peak greenness chemistry bouts, excess air-dried soil is archived in the NEON Biorepository and available upon request. For additional details, see the user guides, protocols, and science designs listed in the Documentation section below. Queries for this data product will return field collection metadata as well as physical and chemical measurements for the specified sites within the specified date range. Summary tables of external lab precision and accuracy for chemistry and stable isotope analyses are included in the expanded package. This data product also provides field and laboratory metadata that can be associated with soil microbial data products; refer to the documentation for the respective soil microbe data products for more details.

Brief Design Description: Three pre-determined, randomly assigned locations are selected for each sampling event at each of 10 plots distributed throughout a site; sampling locations within a plot are not re-sampled. Soil sampling occurs 1-3 times per year depending on length of growing season, with each site always sampled during the historic peak in vegetation greenness. Soil samples are collected to a maximum depth of 30 cm, with organic and mineral soils sampled separately. Soil coring devices are generally 2-2.25” diameter, although the type of device varies based on local soil types and is recorded in the data and collection protocol. In-situ soil temperature is measured, soil samples are homogenized in the field, and subsamples destined for microbial archive and/or analyses are immediately frozen on dry ice. Gravimetric soil moisture and soil pH analyses are conducted at NEON regional laboratories. Every five years, inorganic N pools (NH4+ and NO3-) are measured on fresh and field-incubated soil cores using potassium chloride (KCl) extractions during all bouts of that year. The difference in N concentration between initial and incubated samples can be used to estimate net N transformation rates, see https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-Nitrogen-Transformations. Every five years, peak greenness subsamples are analyzed for total organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations and stable isotopes.

Brief Study Area Description: These data are collected at all NEON terrestrial sites with sufficient soil depths to enable sampling.

ISSUE LOG
----------

This log provides a list of issues identified during data collection or processing, prior to publication
of this data package. For a more recent log, please visit this data product's detail page at
https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10086.001.

Issue Date: 2023-09-25
Issue: Lab summary correction for C-N data: The table `bgc_CNiso_externalSummary` reports the precision and accuracy of carbon and nitrogen concentration and stable isotope measurements of plant and soil samples, based on analysis of secondary reference materials treated as unknowns. The University of Wyoming Stable Isotope Facility had been reporting their summary statistics since 2015 but had mis-interpreted the definitions of some reported uncertainty fields.
    Date Range: 2015-03-16 to 2023-08-18
    Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2023-12-31
Resolution: The lab re-generated all summary statistics according to the formulas and definitions expected by NEON and uploaded these corrected values to the NEON data portal. This updated version of the `bgc_CNiso_externalSummary` table is available with download of provisional data and will appear in RELEASE-2024 and onward.

Issue Date: 2023-11-09
Issue: SubplotId change: The Base plot subplot naming convention was ambiguous with respect to location and scale, and not well differentiated from the identifiers of the points that spatially define Base plots.
    Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2023-12-31
    Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites
Resolution Date: 2023-12-31
Resolution: The subplot naming convention is updated across all data products with observations and samples that originate from Base plots. The format consists of the identity of the plot point in the southwest corner of the subplot, the scale or size of the subplot, and, for those subplots smaller than 100 m2, the corner of the 100 m2 subplot in which the smaller subplot is located. For example, ‘21_400’ refers to point 21 in the southwest corner and is 400 m2 (20 m x 20 m), and ‘31_1_1’ is a subplot with point 31 in the southwest corner, is 1 m2, and is in corner 1 of the 100 m2 subplot with point 31 in the southwest corner. See the associated Data Notification for further detail: https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/neon-terrestrial-observation-system-tos-base-plot-subplot-renaming.

Issue Date: 2023-09-25
Issue: KCl analysis protocol issue: As with all external laboratories, the University of Florida Wetland Biogeochemical Lab shared their standard operating procedures (SOPs) for analysis of soil inorganic nitrogen in NEON potassium chloride (KCl) extracts when they started analyzing samples in 2019. However, the documents that have been shared with users for the last several years do not completely reflect procedures used by the lab. There are a few instances of differences in preparation of reagents and/or standard curves between actual lab practices versus what's recorded in publicly available SOP documents. The differences are subtle and should not impact the data quality or reported values, but available documentation should exactly match laboratory practices.
    Date Range: 2018-11-01 to 2023-10-01
    Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2023-10-01
Resolution: The previously shared versions of the KCl analysis SOPs with minor inaccuracies compared to actual lab practice have been moved to the 'Past Versions' folder in the External Lab Protocols > Terrestrial Biogeochemistry area of the NEON Document Library. These will remain available for reference and traceability, but were never used for sample analysis and have been marked as 'deprecated.' The accurate versions of the SOPs have been posted to the Document Library and shared on the data portal landing page for DP1.10086.001.

Issue Date: 2023-09-26
Issue: MLBS 2023 peak green missing N-trans: The MLBS site conducted soil nitrogen transformations sampling during the field season of 2023. Unfortunately, all potassium chloride (KCl) extracts from the peak green bout were destroyed in transit on their way to the analytical lab. Therefore, the data for soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations and net transformation rates will be permanently missing for that bout.
    Date Range: 2023-07-10 to 2023-08-01
    Location(s) Affected: MLBS
Resolution Date: 2023-09-27
Resolution: All affected peak green samples have been marked as sampleCondition = 'sample lost' in the `ntr_internalLab` table, with a remark describing the situation.

Issue Date: 2023-09-13
Issue: BARR 2022 missing N-trans: The BARR site was scheduled to conduct soil nitrogen transformations sampling in the summer of 2022. Due to a variety of access issues and bad weather, the NEON team was not able to conduct initial soil sampling until late August. This was too late to install incubation samples for later pickup. As such, there is extractable inorganic N concentration data, but net N transformation rates were not measured (no t-final samples installed).
    Date Range: 2022-08-24 to 2022-08-28
    Location(s) Affected: BARR
Resolution Date: 2023-09-26
Resolution: A dataQF entry of 'missing-N-trans' has been added to the t-initial samples for this bout in the `sls_soilCoreCollection` table.

Issue Date: 2024-03-07
Issue: KCl extracts filter deviation: When extracting soils in potassium chloride (KCl) to determine inorganic nitrogen content, the standard NEON protocol requires use of GF/A filters (Particle Retention = 1.6 μm) to prepare the extracts. However, in Domain 3, GF/C filters (Particle Retention = 1.2 μm) were ordered in March of 2018 and almost certainly used to prepare soil KCl extracts in DSNY in 2018, and quite likely used to prepare KCl extracts from JERC in 2019 and OSBS in 2021.
    Date Range: 2018-03-06 to 2021-11-04
    Location(s) Affected: DSNY, JERC, OSBS
Resolution Date: 2023-03-13
Resolution: Starting in March of 2023, e.g., the next time KCl extracts were prepared in the domain, the correct GF/A filters were ordered and used for all soil KCl extractions conducted that year. Since the pore sizes are so similar for GF/A vs GF/C, little to no data impact is expected, however the importance of following standard equipment lists has been stressed.

Issue Date: 2023-11-04
Issue: ORNL 2021 missing pH: Following the fall 2021 soil sampling bout at site ORNL, all soil samples were mistakenly discarded before pH measurements could be taken. As such, there are field collected subsamples and moisture data, but no pH measurements.
    Date Range: 2021-11-02 to 2021-11-03
    Location(s) Affected: ORNL
Resolution Date: 2022-11-22
Resolution: A dataQF entry of 'missing‐pH‐Data' was added to the records for this bout in the sls_soilCoreCollection table.

Issue Date: 2022-09-15
Issue: Toolik Field Station required a quarantine period prior to starting work in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 field seasons to protect all personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This complicated NEON field scheduling logistics, which typically involves repeated travel across the state on short time frames. Consequently, NEON reduced staff traveling to Toolik and was thus unable to complete all planned sampling efforts. Missed data collection events are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical field.
    Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2022-12-31
    Location(s) Affected: TOOL
Resolution Date: 2022-10-31
Resolution: The quarantine policy at Toolik Field Station ended after the 2022 field season.

Issue Date: 2022-09-15
Issue: Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff. Observational data collection was halted during this time. Canceled data collection events are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical field.
    Date Range: 2022-06-12 to 2022-10-31
    Location(s) Affected: YELL
Resolution Date: 2022-10-31
Resolution: Normal operations resumed on October 31, 2022, when the National Park Service opened a newly constructed road from Gardiner, MT to Mammoth, WY with minimal restrictions. For more details about data impacts, see Data Notification https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/data-impacts-neons-yellowstone-sites-yell-blde-due-catastrophic-flooding-0

Issue Date: 2022-11-15
Issue: Microbial storage changes: In 2021, we began to have issues procuring key supplies for microbial collection and sample preservation. Specifically, some domains could not reliably source dry ice, and all domains could not purchase the 5 mL liquid nitrogen safe cryovials used for microbial genetic archive samples according to the sampling protocol. In order keep collecting, it was necessary to adopt alternate procedures and supplies, but fields did not exist in the data to communicate these changes.
    Date Range: 2021-01-01 to 2022-08-02
    Location(s) Affected: All Terrestrial Sites
Resolution Date: 2022-08-03
Resolution: We issued guidance for storing microbial samples on ultra-cold ice packs when dry ice cannot be sourced. These ice packs are stored overnight in an ultra-low temperature freezer, allowing for temperatures between -60 to -30 C in field coolers for up to eight hours. We added two new fields in the sls.soilCoreCollection table, ‘geneticSamplePrepMethod’ and ‘geneticArchiveSamplePrepMethod’ to indicate the field preservation method used. Before 2022-02-01, empty values can be interpreted as ‘dry ice.’ Additionally, we allowed storage of frozen archive soil samples in 2 mL liquid nitrogen safe tissue vials when 5 mL cryovials are not available. We added a new field to the sls.soilCoreCollection table, ‘geneticArchiveContainer’ to indicate container type and size. Before 2022-08-03, values will be empty. See the Data Product User Guide for general types of frozen archive containers used over time in the NEON project.

Issue Date: 2020-09-16
Issue: Negative inorganic N concentrations: In some nitrogen transformation data, blank-corrected sample concentration values appear significantly negative above background noise, meaning more inorganic N was detected in procedural blanks compared to samples. Extensive troubleshooting has revealed that certain batches of potassium chloride (KCl) used by NEON for extractions have high levels of nitrite, which is chemodenitrified (abiotically converted to nitrogen gas and lost) in the presence of acidic soil, but not in blanks (Homyak et al. 2015). This artifact is what causes the significant negative values and greatly reduces sensitivity of the method for low-concentration sites.
    Date Range: 2017-01-01 to 2022-02-23
    Location(s) Affected: DEJU, DELA, DSNY, GRSM, HARV, JERC, LENO, MLBS, NIWO, PUUM, SERC, SOAP, STEI, TALL, TEAK, UNDE, WREF
Resolution Date: 2022-03-01
Resolution: Starting with the 2022 sampling season and onward, all batches of reagent-grade potassium chloride purchased for soil extractions are tested for nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Nitrite concentrations of less than 0.02 mg N/L are preferred, although up to 0.05 mg N/L is acceptable when KCl is difficult to source due to supply chain issues. Only batches that meet these purity levels will be used for extractions. This should greatly reduce, although not entirely eliminate, the issue with negative sample values. All samples with concentration values that blank-correct to less than -0.02 mg N/L are flagged with 'blanks exceed sample value' in the nitrateNitriteNQF field, and end users can decide how to treat these data.

Issue Date: 2022-02-18
Issue: sampleID format change: The unique sampling location for each soil core had been included in the primary sample identifier (sampleID) for soil samples and all downstream subsample IDs. Specifically, sampleIDs included the distance east and north of the southwest corner of a plot (in meters). However, including high resolution spatial information in sampleIDs proved problematic when the location was mis-transcribed in the field. Such errors are difficult to detect and very time-consuming to correct.
    Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2022-02-01
    Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2022-02-01
Resolution: To improve data accuracy and data QAQC efficiency, the precise sampling locations are no longer included in the sampleID, and the subplot number is used instead (a choice of 21, 23, 39, and 41). The remainder of the sampleID is unchanged, including the plot, soil horizon, and collect date components. Soil core sampling coordinates are still available in the `sls_soilCoreCollection` table in the `coreCoordinateX` and `coreCoordinateY` fields.

Issue Date: 2021-03-17
Issue: Empty data files: A publication error resulted in empty data files for a single site and month of data. These data will be restored in RELEASE-2022.
    Date Range: 2019-06-01 to 2019-06-30
    Location(s) Affected: TALL
Resolution Date: 2022-01-20
Resolution: These data were published in RELEASE-2022

Issue Date: 2021-01-06
Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or canceled sampling activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability may be reduced during this time.
    Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2021-12-31
    Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2021-12-31
Resolution: The primary impact of the pandemic on observational data was reduced data collection. Training procedures and data quality reviews were maintained throughout the pandemic, although some previously in-person training was conducted virtually.  Scheduled measurements and sampling that were not carried out due to COVID-19 or any other causes are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical data field.

Issue Date: 2020-12-01
Issue: Samples not re-dried: Due to a miscommunication, samples analyzed for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and stable isotopes were not re-dried prior to weighing and analysis at the external lab. While all NEON soil samples are dried at 65C in the domain labs, they are often then stored for weeks to months before being shipped to or analyzed by external labs. During this time they may accumulate moisture, especially in humid areas. Subsequent testing revealed that for organic horizons, %C data are likely underestimated by 1.5-2.5% due to this lack of re-drying prior to analysis. As organic horizon soil samples tend to have high %C (> 20%), this bias may have only minor impacts on many analyses, but is something for end users to keep in mind. For the other parameters (%N, C:N, d15N, d13C) as well as all parameters in mineral horizons, testing suggests there were no detectable differences between re-dried samples and originals.
    Date Range: 2014-01-01 to 2020-07-10
    Location(s) Affected: All sites with organic horizon soil chemistry measurements in this date range, with the exception of PUUM whose tissues were re-dried for permitting/quarantine reasons.
Resolution Date: 2020-11-10
Resolution: Affected O-horizon data have been flagged with dataQF = dryingProtocolError in the `sls_soilChemistry` table. For sample analysis dates starting in November 2020, all carbon-nitrogen samples (both mineral and organic horizons) are re-dried at 65C prior to analysis to drive out any residual moisture and improve data accuracy for % C. Samples collected in 2020 may have been analyzed before or after the change; check dataQF to determine which individual samples are affected.

Issue Date: 2020-10-02
Issue: Data products not bundled: Until October 2020, soil physical and chemical properties were published as separate data products.
    Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2020-10-02
    Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites.
Resolution Date: 2020-10-06
Resolution: In October 2020, data tables for physical and chemical properties were bundled together in a single data product for improved usability. This applies to all existing and future data.

Issue Date: 2020-10-12
Issue: No sampling impractical: Prior to the 2020 field season, there was no mechanism to indicate when and why a scheduled sampling event may have been missed.
    Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2020-02-06
    Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites
Resolution Date: 2020-02-06
Resolution: Starting in the 2020 field season, NEON added the field "samplingImpractical" to the `sls_soilCoreCollection` table of this data product to assist users in understanding when data for this product are temporarily missing versus permanently unavailable. If field collection of soil from a specific subplot within an assigned soil plot was not possible, samplingImpractical is populated with a value other than 'OK' (e.g., 'location flooded' or 'logistical') and only minimal metadata are recorded.

Issue Date: 2022-11-15
Issue: pH method change: During periodic soil sampling, pH is measured both in water and calcium chloride. Prior to the 2020 field season, each measurement used separate samples and a 1:2 soil to solution ratio for mineral horizons (organic horizons need higher ratios to saturate the soil). This process was time-consuming and resulted in double the containers needing to be washed.
    Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2019-12-31
    Location(s) Affected: All Terrestrial Sites
Resolution Date: 2020-01-01
Resolution: In 2020, we adopted the pH method of the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, which uses a single container and soil sample to measure pH with both methods. First, water is added to soil and pH is measured at 1:1 soil to solution. Then an equal volume of calcium chloride is added to the same container and pH is measured again at 1:2 soil to solution. These ratios generally apply to mineral soils, more solution is used for organic soils as well as very hygroscopic mineral soils. Soil to solution ratios are recorded in the sls_soilpH table in the 'waterpHRatio' and 'caclpHRatio' fields. Before implementing the change, tests from a small number of sites suggested there would be no impact to the data. However, in reviewing data from all sites after the change was implemented, there may be site-specific effects of the method change on perceived soil pH, especially in water-prepared mineral horizon samples.

Issue Date: 2024-08-19
Issue: Reduced marker gene frequency: For the first several years of NEON soil sampling, marker gene data were produced for all soil samples at all sites and collection bouts. Due to resource constraints, this frequency was not sustainable.
    Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2018-12-31
    Location(s) Affected: ABBY, BARR, BART, BLAN, DCFS, DEJU, DELA, DSNY, GRSM, HEAL, JERC, JORN, KONA, LAJA, LENO, MLBS, MOAB, NOGP, OAES, RMNP, SERC, SOAP, STEI, STER, TEAK, TREE, UKFS
Resolution Date: 2019-01-01
Resolution: While terrestrial core sites continue to produce marker gene data for all collection bouts, gradient terrestrial sites reduced marker gene data frequency to all bouts in the year, once every five years in conjunction with coordinated biogeochemistry sampling.

Issue Date: 2024-08-19
Issue: Reduced metagenome frequency: For the first several years of NEON sampling, soil microbe metagenome data were produced at all sites annually, during the period of peak greenness. Due to resource constraints, this frequency was not sustainable.
    Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2018-12-31
    Location(s) Affected: ABBY, BARR, BART, BLAN, DCFS, DEJU, DELA, DSNY, GRSM, HEAL, JERC, JORN, KONA, LAJA, LENO, MLBS, MOAB, NOGP, OAES, RMNP, SERC, SOAP, STEI, STER, TEAK, TREE, UKFS
Resolution Date: 2019-01-01
Resolution: While terrestrial core sites continue to produce soil microbe metagenome data annually from the peak green collection bout, gradient terrestrial sites reduced metagenome data frequency to once every five years during peak green in conjunction with coordinated biogeochemistry sampling.

Issue Date: 2020-09-16
Issue: Type II water in 2017: In 2017, the first year nitrogen transformation data were collected, Type II (1 Mohm) water was used to create 2M KCl solutions and conduct extractions. However, this purity is not sufficient and Type I water (18.2 Mohm) has been used for all bouts conducted from 2018 onward. 2017 data was thus collected using a deprecated method and has been flagged accordingly. Moreover, 2 sites extracted in 2017 (JORN AND MOAB) had extremely high ammonium concentrations in both samples and blanks (> 1 mg/L) due to this use of less pure water. These data were deemed unusable, thus values were removed and the records have an additional flag.
    Date Range: 2017-01-01 to 2018-01-01
    Location(s) Affected: KONZ, JORN, MOAB, ORNL, SCBI, STEI, STER, TOOL, TALL
Resolution Date: 2018-01-01
Resolution: Type I water (18.2 Mohm) has been used for all nitrogen transformation bouts conducted from 2018 onward, and 2017 records have been flagged.

Issue Date: 2022-11-15
Issue: Alaska soil horizon boundaries: Due to slow rates of organic matter decomposition, organic soils in Alaska sites often appear less decomposed, but are considered soil, compared to organic horizons in CONUS sites. In the early years of sampling, NEON technicians were likely grouping the top‐most fibric material in measurements of litter depth and excluding it from O‐horizon soil samples.
    Date Range: 2015-01-01 to 2017-12-31
    Location(s) Affected: TOOL, BARR, DEJU, BONA, and HEAL
Resolution Date: 2018-01-01
Resolution: After conferring with the research community, we clarified the instructions for determining the boundary between litter and soil in NEON Alaska sites. From 2018 onward, all non‐green, friable fibric material that has roots growing in it is classified as organic soil and sampled as such, rather than being measured as litter. We recommend users keep in mind this method change and use caution when comparing soil data from these five sites collected before and after 2018. Older data have ‘alaskaDeprecatedMethod’ indicated in the dataQF field in `sls.soilCoreCollection`.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------


A record from `sls_soilCoreCollection` may have zero or one child records in `sls_soilpH` and `sls_soilMoisture`; a given `sls_soilCoreCollection.sampleID` is expected to be sampled one time per collectDate (local time). Depending on the type of bout and time of year, a record from `sls_soilCoreCollection` may have zero or one child records in `sls_metagenomicsPooling`, `sls_bgcSubsampling`, and `ntr_internalLab`. Each child record from `ntr_internalLab` may appear from zero to two times in the `ntr_externalLab` table, and each child record from `sls_bgcSubsampling` may appear from one to four times in `sls_soilChemistry` (depending on analytical replicates and sample pretreatment for bulk C and N). The information needed to link procedural blanks with sample KCl extracts is provided in `ntr_externalLabBlanks`, and paired fresh/incubated samples can be linked through the `ntr_internalLab.incubationPairID` field. Duplicates may exist where protocol and/or data entry aberrations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before joining tables.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

NEON data are initially published with a status of Provisional, in which updates to data and/or processing
algorithms will occur on an as-needed basis, and query reproducibility cannot be guaranteed. Once data are published
as part of a Data Release, they are no longer provisional, and are associated with a stable DOI.
